              The internet is a vast and powerful tool that can help us access a
              lot of information in a matter of seconds, but it can also be
              overwhelming and confusing for many users. And searching for
              information on the internet can be a daunting task for anyone, but
              especially for Arabic speakers who may face some difficulties in
              finding the relevant and reliable sources they need. Some of the
              information they are looking for may not be available in Arabic,
              or it may be scattered across different websites that are not
              user-friendly. One of the problems that the Arab world suffers
              from is the lack of a trustworthy and comprehensive source of
              knowledge on various topics and fields. The Arab knowledge-sharing
              platform is a project that aims to address this problem by
              creating a centralized platform where Arabs can ask and answer
              questions on different subjects. The platform will allow users to
              share their knowledge, learn from others, and contribute to the
              development of knowledge in the region. The quality and
              credibility of the information available online can vary greatly,
              depending on the source and the author. Therefore, many usersâ€™
              resorts to social media platforms to seek help from other users
              who might have similar questions or experiences. However, this
              approach has its own limitations and drawbacks. For instance,
              social media groups can be crowded and noisy, making it hard to
              find the best answer among many opinions and comments.
              Additionally, social media users may not have the expertise or the
              qualifications to provide accurate and trustworthy answers.

              The Arab world faces challenges in accessing relevant and reliable
              information on the internet due to factors such as limited
              availability of Arabic content, scattered information sources, and
              user-unfriendly websites. Arabic speakers encounter difficulties
              in finding trustworthy and comprehensive knowledge on various
              topics. Existing social media platforms, while used for seeking
              help, suffer from limitations such as overcrowding, noise, and the
              potential lack of expertise among users providing answers.
              Therefore, there is a need for a centralized and credible Arab
              knowledge-sharing platform that facilitates access to accurate
              information, fosters learning, and enables contributions to
              knowledge development in the region.
